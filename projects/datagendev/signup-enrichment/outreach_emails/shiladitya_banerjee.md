## Account Activity Summary

### Signup & Usage
- **Signed up:** Nov 20, 2025 (9 days ago)
- **Last active:** Nov 25, 2025 (4 days ago)
- **Platform usage:** 0 runs executed
- **Credits remaining:** 100 (untouched)

### Behavioral Analysis

**✅ What He Did:**
1. **Logged into the app** on signup day (Nov 20, 13:19-13:20)
2. Visited marketing site multiple times checking:
   - Examples section
   - Pricing page (twice)
   - Multiple homepage visits

**❌ What Went Wrong:**
- **< 1 minute in-app session** before bouncing
- Rapid navigation through 7 pages in 55 seconds:
  - `/signalgen/chat` → `/mcp-servers` → `/runs` → `/tools` → `/mcp-usage` → `/runs` → `/mcp-servers` → **LEFT**
- Classic "lost user" behavior - circular navigation pattern
- Saw empty states everywhere (no runs, no tools, no servers)
- Never returned to the app (only marketing site)

**🔍 Root Cause:**
- **Poor onboarding** - dropped into app with no guidance
- **Empty state problem** - no examples or templates to get started
- **Overwhelming complexity** - too many concepts (MCP servers, tools, runs)
- **Missing starting point** - data scientist wanted simple workflow, got confusion

## Email Draft

**Subject:** Hey Shiladitya - got stuck in the app last week?

**Body:**

Hi Shiladitya,

I noticed you signed up for DataGen last week and clicked through the app on Nov 20, but it looks like you got a bit lost (you jumped through 7 different pages in under a minute 😅).

I'm guessing the interface was confusing without a clear starting point - we definitely have an onboarding problem we're working on.

**Quick question:** What were you hoping to build when you signed up?

As a data scientist at PhonePe, I'm guessing you might be dealing with:
- Enriching user/merchant profiles at scale?
- Building automated data pipelines?
- Lead scoring or segmentation workflows?

If any of those resonate, I'd love to show you how DataGen works in **5 minutes** - specifically how to:
- Enrich a CSV of contacts with LinkedIn/company data
- Set up automated data quality checks
- Build API workflows without writing code

No pressure at all - just want to make sure you didn't bounce because of bad UX vs. the product not being relevant for you.

Let me know if a quick call would be helpful!

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. You still have 100 credits unused - happy to walk you through your first workflow if you're interested.

## Follow-up Strategy

**If no response in 3 days:**
- Send case study: "How [Similar Fintech] uses DataGen for merchant enrichment"
- Offer: Pre-built template for common data science workflows

**If interested:**
- Schedule 15-min demo
- Show: CSV enrichment → Lead scoring → CRM integration
- Focus: Speed & simplicity (not MCP complexity)

## Notes
- Emphasize he's not alone - many users get stuck on first login
- Acknowledge the UX problem (builds trust)
- Make it low-pressure and helpful
- Show you understand his use case (PhonePe data scientist = credibility)
